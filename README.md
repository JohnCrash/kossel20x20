==============

Johann is offering free printed parts for Mini Kossel:

* I'm going to make some Mini Kossel printed parts kits.
* I'm going to give them away for free (as in beer).
* Some kits may include some non-printed parts.
* Free international shipping is included.
* No delivery schedule, maybe only one kit per month.

But there's no such thing as a free lunch. If you want to receive a
free kit, you must swear by your geek honor:

* To complete your Mini Kossel and tune it well.
* To print two (2) Mini Kossel kits and also give them away for free.
* To make your recipients agree to the same rule.

After giving away the 2 free kits, you may sell printed parts for any
price you want.

If you're interested, please email johann@rocholl.net and let me know
your favorite PLA color and mailing address. If you want to get your
printed parts first, explain why you're more qualified than others to
start giving away high quality printed parts soon.
